Room Editor Version History1.00•	Original release.1.01•	I don;t remember what I added to this upgrade.1.02•	Handle the mix-up when checking 'deep' resource in art files.•	Updated Casady & Greene, Inc. address in About Room Editor 1.0… dialog box.•	Got rid of that Glider 1.0 panel that would come up in About Room Editor 1.0… box.1.03•	Renamed art files to "B&W Art" and "Color Art".•	Upgraded to "About… 2.1" library.•	Added a color animated cursor (just like Glider 4.05).•	Opening art files is 'smarter' (i.e. will first check for appropriate default file names - if in color mode, the Editor looks for "Color Art").•	Fixed the 'glide ratio' bug where the glider flew farther in the Room Editor with respect to Glider itself.•	The "House Info…" dialog box now supports locking of a house (you can't unlock it though).•	The grease is now "operational" - you can slide along it.
